The Project was for a Client which had to be abruptly shut down.

All the designs and animations were created as per the designs of the client.

To run app : 
DownLoad the zip file and extract it. 
Open it in IDE
Type "Flutter Pub Get" on terminal to get all dependencies
Then run the app on emulator

As the app is not complete you might have to change the page you want to see in the main.dart file.
